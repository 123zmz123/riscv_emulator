# how it started
this project is inspired by the great online tutorial
1. https://book.rvemu.app/
2. https://github.com/siriusdemon/Rare   
by re-writing a riscv RAV64  emulator I really learned a lot about how a modern cpu work, and how the page table worked.
now I can say I understand riscv core.

# how to use it
cargo run xv6-kernel.bin xv6-fs.img

cargo build --release version will speed up the emulator
